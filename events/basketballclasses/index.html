                    In this project, we look to inspire the youth to endorse in sports programs like basketball. During the last year, we have worked on rebuilding and improving basketball courts in schools in our community. We did this with the idea to teach the children to play basketball and get them excited about sports and exercise, helping them keep a healthy lifestyle.
                    We will also be attending the schools and give basketball classes to the children in order to prepare them for the tournament, these classes will be held after schools and volunteers will attend the schools and teach the children the fundamental basket ball skills through a program that we will prepare with the help of basketball coaches. Finally, comes the tournament which will take place in March 2023, this tournament will need lots of planning and fundraising as well as sponsors in order for it to be successful and one that the children can enjoy and put their learned skill to great use in a fun friendly tournament.
