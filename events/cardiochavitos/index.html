				We will start at 7:30am and end at about 12:00 pm. The activity will be located in Fundidora, and our meet up location is still to be decided. When you arrive, the first thing you will do is check in with Isabela GÃ³mez. <br>
				The purpose of the activity as a whole is to raise money for Cardio Chavitos to pay for their surgeries. The volunteers will impact the race by not only helping the people participating in the event, but also by assisting the cardio chavitos team in the event. The volunteers will also impact the cause by helping raise money and make the Cardio Chavitos organization known to more people. <br>
