                    Powerchair is a community where we provide the necessary needs for physically diables people of all ages to enjoy the thrill of soccer. To do so accordingly, we require volunteers to assist the players (adjusting the chair components, helping them get in and out of the chair, setting up cones, helping the players with their training, etc.). Volunteers are required to commit from INITIAL DATE to FINAL DATE attending each Saturday for a 2-hour shift.  (Volunteers are welcome to sign up for more than one shift).
