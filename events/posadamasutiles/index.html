                The activity will take place on December 13 from 3-5pm volunteers will go to the school directly after school in their own cars, carpooling is encouraged due to limited parking space. Food for volunteers will be provided at the posada, the basis of the activity consists in interacting with children and essentially making them have a good time. We will provide the kids with activities such piñatas, games like loteria, pasting the donkey’s tail, etc. Volunteers will help guide those activities, we will provide materials for such. There will be children with special needs who may not be able to participate in some activities, so it is important to keep them engaged anyway.  As soon as we get there lunch will be provided for both volunteers and the students, volunteers will also help ease that process by keeping children organized and mention that it is important for the portion size to be respected seeing that the food is limited. Before we leave, we will hand the students a small gift and again it is important to maintain organization in that process, volunteers will be in charge.
