				The goal of this program is to promote the reading and comprehension skills of students in public schools. Matilda by Roald Dahl allows the students to grow as people and learners. By being part of this program you will be visiting one of the two public schools in the program every week starting on January 30th until June 4th. Some weeks will be dedicated to an engaging activity and others on reading aloud until the book is finished. The final activity will be watching the movie  <br>
				“Matilda” with the students. Participation will be required during school hours meaning volunteers will dedicate a study hall a week and must have open campus. Apart from the visits volunteers are also required to pay $500 for supply expenses and attend weekly meetings in order to discuss and be prepared for their lessons.
