				We will start at 8:00am and end at about 11:00 am. The first thing you will do when you arrive at the location is check in with Isabela Gómez Guajardo. The purpose of the activity as a whole is to raise money for CardioChavitos to pay for their surgeries. The volunteers will impact the race by not only helping the people participating in the event, but also by assisting the cardiochavitos team in the event. The volunteers will also impact the cause by helping raise money and make the CardioChavitos organization known to more people.
