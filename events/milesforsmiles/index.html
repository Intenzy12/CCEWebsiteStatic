                Every year, the ASFM Operation Smile Club works towards collaborating with Operation Smile Mexico A.C. in support of patients, primarily low income children, with cleft lip or pallet to provide free repairment procedures. One of the main ways we do this is by organizing a charity race, dubbed “Miles for Smiles”, in which students participate in fundraising and organizing the race– last year having sold over 1400 tickets and helping provide 33 surgeries. On top of this, the club works to assist Operation Smile by volunteering at the medical missions where surgeries are done and providing assistance to patients and their families through small events and service projects.
